# MagiskHide Props Config
## By Didgeridoohan @ XDA Developers


[Support Thread @ XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228)


## What's this?
This module is a very complicated way of doing something very simple. Complicated for me, that is... The aim is to make it easy for you, the user. The module changes prop values using the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop), something that is very easy to do with a [Magisk boot script](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/details.md#boot-stages) and some simple commands.

What this module does is that it adds a terminal based UI for those that don't want (or can't) create a boot script for themselves, making the process of creating such a boot script very simple. With this module I'm also maintaining a list of certified build fingerprints for a number of devices, so that it's easy to pick one you want to use.


## Installation
Install through the Magisk Manager Downloads section. Or, download the zip from the Manager or the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), and install through the Magisk Manager -> Modules, or from recovery.

The current release is always attached to the OP of the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228). Any previous releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/releases).


## Usage
After installing the module and rebooting, run the command `props` in a terminal emulator (you can find a one on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) or in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps)), and follow the instructions to set your desired options. If you use Termux, you'll have to call su before running the command.

You can also run the command with options. Use -h for details.


## Spoofing device's fingerprint to pass the ctsProfile check
If your device can't pass SafetyNet fully, the CTS profile check fails while basic integrity passes, that means MagiskHide is working on your device but Google doesn't recognise your device as being certified.

This might be because your device simply hasn't been certified or that the ROM you are using on your device isn't recognised by Google (because it's a custom ROM). 

To fix this, you can use a known working fingerprint (one that has been certified by Google), usually from a stock ROM/firmware/factory image, and replace your device's current fingerprint with this. You can also use a fingerprint from another device, but this will change how your device is perceived.

There are a few pre-configured certified fingerprints available in the module, just in case you can't get a hold of one for your device. If you have a working fingerprint that could be added to the list, or an updated one for one already on there, please post that in the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) toghether with device details. Please also include the Android security patch date for the factory image/firmware/ROM that the fingerprint comes from.

### Matching the Android security patch date
For some devices, if the fingerprint is for Android Pie (9), it is necessary to use a security patch date that matches the fingerprint used. For the module provided fingerprints this is done automatically, but if you enter a fingerprint manually you will have to update the security patch date yourself (if they don't already match). Use the [Custom prop](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date.

### Can I use any fingerprint?
It's possible to use any fingerprint that's certified for your device. It doesn't have to match, either device or Android version. If you don't use a fingerprint for your device, the device might be percieved as the device that the fingerprint belongs to, in certain situations (Play Store, etc). The Android version doesn't matter much, and if you're using a ROM with an Android version much newer than what is officially available for your device, you are going to have to use an older fingerprint if you want to use the one for your device. But, like already stated, that doesn't really matter.

### Finding a certified fingerprint
#### The getprop method
If you don't want to use one of the provided fingerprints, you can get one for your device by running the getprop command below on a stock ROM/firmware/factory image that fully passes SafetyNet.
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```
If you're already on a custom ROM that can't pass the CTS profile check, this might not be an option... Head over to your device's forum and ask for help. If someone can run the getprop command on their device for you, you're good to go. Or, you can try the other method described below.

*Note that this is the only surefire way of getting the proper fingerprint.*

#### The stock ROM/firmware/factory image method
Another way to find a certified fingerprint is to download a stock ROM/firmware/factory image for your device and extract the fingerprint from there.

*Note that this is possibly not the best way of finding the fingerprint. Using getprop is always preferred.*

You can find the file to download in your device's forum on XDA Developers (either as a firmware file, a proper stock ROM, or in the development section as a debloated stock ROM), from the manufacturer's website, or elsewhere on the great interweb (just remember to be careful when downloading unknown files, it's dangerous to go alone!).

Once you have the file downloaded, there are several different ways that the fingerprint can be found. In all cases you'll have to access the file somehow, and in most cases it's just a matter of unpackaging it. After that it depends on how the package is constructed.

- Sometimes there'll be a build.prop file directly in the zip/package. You'll likely find the fingerprint in there.
- For some devices you'll have to unpackage the system.img to get to the build.prop file. On Windows, you can use something like [this tool](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=57742855&postcount=42). You'll also find more info in the [main thread for that post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/how-to-conver-lollipop-dat-files-to-t2978952).
- Other times you'll find the fingerprint in META-INF\com\google\android\updater-script. Look for "Target:" and you'll likely find the fingerprint there.
- Etc... Experiment, the fingerprint will be in there somewhere. 

Take a look below for an example of what a device fingerprint looks like.

#### The firmware.mobi method
Sometimes you can also find up to date and certified fingerprints at [firmware.mobi](https://desktop.firmware.mobi/).

### Custom fingerprints list
You can add your own fingerprint to the list by placing a file, named `printslist` (no file extension), in the root of your internal storage with the fingerprint. It needs to be formated as follows: `device name=fingerprint`.
Here's an example:
```
Google Nexus 6=google/shamu/shamu:7.1.1/N8I11B/4171878:user/release-keys
```
NOTE: If you're using a fingerprint for Android Pie (9) you might have to change the security patch date to one that matches the fingerprint used. This can be done directly in the fingerprints list, by adding a paragraph sign (`ยง`) at the end of the fingerprint directly followed by the date (`ยง2018-09-05`). You can also use the [Custom prop](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#changeset-custom-prop-values) function of this module to change `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the desired date.


### I still can't pass the ctsProfile check
If you've picked a certified fingerprint from the provided list, or you're using a fingerprint that you know is certified but still can't pass the ctsProfile check, try one or more of the following:
- First, do you pass basicIntegrity? If you don't, there's something else going on that this module can't help you with. Take a look under ["Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) below.
- Go into the script options and move the execution of the boot script to post-fs-data. See ["Boot stage"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) below.
- Try a different fingerprint (pick one from the provided list).
- Some ROMs will just not be able to pass the ctsProfile check, if they contain signs of a rooted/modified device that Magisk can't hide. Check in your ROM thread or with the creator/developer.
- You might have remnants of previous modifications that trigger SafetyNet on your device. A clean install of your system may be required.
- If you can't get things working, and want help, make sure to provide logs and details. See ["Logs"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#logs) below.


## Keeping your device "certified"
If you're using a custom ROM, the chances of it being [perceived as uncertified by Google](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-blocks-gapps-uncertified-devices-custom-rom-whitelist/) are pretty high. If your ROM has a build date later than March 16 2018, this might mean that you can't even log into your Google account or use Gapps without [whitelisting your device with Google](https://www.google.com/android/uncertified/) first.

Magisk, and this module, can help with that.

Before setting up your device, install Magisk, this module and use the configuration file described below to pass the ctsProfile check. This should make your device be perceived as certified by Google and you can log into your Google account and use your device without having to whitelist it. Check [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/common/prints.sh) for usable fingerprints (only use the part to the right of the equal sign).

If you're having issues getting your device certified, take a look in the Magisk troubleshooting guide linked below.

In case you can't get the Play Store to report your device as "certified", see ["Issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#issues-support-etc) below.

## Current fingerprints list version
The fingerprints list will update without the need to update the entire module. Keep an eye on the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) for info.

Just run the `props` command and the list will be updated automatically. Use the -nw option to disable or disable it completely in the script settings (see ["Prop script settings"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#prop-script-settings) below). If you've disabled the this setting you can update the list manually in the `Edit device fingerprint` menu.

**_Current fingerprints list version - v32_**


## Please add support for device X
Adding device fingerprints to the list relies heavily on the users. You guys. I've looked up a fingerprint from time to time, but it is a bit time consuming and I don't have that time...
	
If you want a specific device fingerprint to be added to the module, see [Finding a certified fingerprint](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#finding-a-certified-fingerprint) above. If you can find a fingerprint for the device you have in mind, post it in the thread. I'll test it out and if it passes the ctsProfile check I'll add it to the list. Please also include the Android security patch date for the factory image/firmware/ROM that the fingerprint comes from.


## Improved root hiding - Editing build.prop and default.prop
In some rare cases, apps and services look at the actual files (build.prop and default.prop), rather than the set prop values. With this module feature you can make sure that the actual prop in build.prop and default.prop is changed to match whatever value the prop has been set to by either MagiskHide or the module. If there's a prop value set by the module (see ["Set/reset MagiskHide Sensitive props"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#setreset-magiskhide-sensitive-props) below), that value takes precedence.


## Set/reset MagiskHide Sensitive props
By default, if MagiskHide detects certain sensitive prop values they will be changed to known safe values. These are currently:
- ro.debuggable (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")
- ro.secure (set to "1" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "0")
- ro.build.type (set to "user" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "userdebug")
- ro.build.tags (set to "release-keys" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "test-keys" or "dev-keys")
- ro.build.selinux (set to "0" by MagiskHide - sensitive value is "1")

If, for some reason, you need one or more of these to be kept as their original value (one example would be resetting ro.build.type to userdebug since some ROMs need this to work properly), you can reset to the original value with this module. Keep in mind that this might trigger some apps looking for these prop values as a sign of your device being rooted.


## Change/set custom prop values
It's quite easy to change prop values with Magisk. With this module it's even easier. Just enter the prop you want to change and the new value and the module does the rest, nice and systemless. Any changes that you've previously done directly to build.prop, default.prop, etc, you can now do with this module instead.

When setting a custom prop you can also pick in what boot stage it should be set in. This can also be changed later for each individual custom prop. There are three options:
- Default - The main module option will decide (see [Prop script settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#boot-stage) below).
- post-fs-data - The prop will always be set in post-fs-data, regardless of the main module option.
- late_start service - The prop will always be set in late_start service, regardless of the main module option.

Note: post-fs-data runs earlier than late_start service.

### My build.prop doesn't change after setting a custom prop
Magisk doesn't alter the build.prop file when changing a custom prop value, it simply loads the new value instead of the one in build.prop. If you want to check if the new value has been loaded you can see this by selecting the prop in the "Add/edit custom props" menu of the `props` script.

You can also use the `getprop` command in a terminal emulator to check the set value. Example:
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```


## Removing prop values
If you would like to delete a certain prop value from your system, that can be done with the [Magisk resetprop tool](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/blob/master/docs/tools.md#resetprop). With this module you can easily set that up by adding whatever prop you want removed to the "Delete props" list. Be very careful when using this option, since removing the wrong prop may cause isses with your device. See ["Device issues because of the module"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#device-issues-because-of-the-module) below if this happens.

### My build.prop doesn't change after removing a prop value
Magisk doesn't alter the build.prop file when removing a prop value, it simply prevents the prop to load instead of removing it from build.prop. If you want to check if the prop has been removed use the `getprop` command in a terminal emulator to check. Example:
```
getprop ro.build.fingerprint
```
If the prop has been removed, the command should return nothing.


## Prop script settings
There are a couple of persistent options that you can set for the `props` script. These are currently "Boot stage", "Script colours" and "Fingerprints list check". The options are found under "Script settings" when running the `props` script. The settings menu can also be opened by using the -s option (use -h for details).

### Boot stage
It's possible to move the execution of the boot script from the default post-fs-data to late_start service. Running the script in post-fs-data is required for the SafetyNet fix and custom props to work on some ROM/device combinations, and is also more reliable overall. If there are any kind of issues during boot, try changing the boot stage to late_start service instead. Just keep in mind that this might cause setting the build fingerprint to fail.

Note: post-fs-data runs earlier than late_start service.

### Script colours
This option will disable or enable colours for the `props` script.

### Fingerprints list check
This option will disable or enable the automatic updating of the fingerprints list when the `props` script starts. If the fingerprints list check is disabled, the list can be manually updated from within the script, under the `Edit device fingerprint` menu, or with the -f option (use -h for details).


## Configuration file
You can use a configuration file to set your desired options, rather than running the `props` command. Download the [settings file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/master/common/propsconf_conf) or extract it from the module zip (in the common folder), fill in the desired options (follow the instructions in the file), place it in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device) and reboot.

This can also be done directly at the first install (through Manager or recovery) and even on a brand new clean install of Magisk, before even rebooting your device. Upon detecting the file, the module boot script will load the configured values and then delete the the configuration file. Instant settings.

### Setting up the module on a clean ROM flash
After having made a clean ROM flash, the configuration file can be used to set the module up as you want without even having to boot first. Just flash the ROM, Magisk and then the module. If you then place a configuration file with your desired settings (fingerprint, custom props, etc) in /cache (or /data/cache if you're using an A/B device), this will be loaded during the first boot. It is possible that this won't work an all device/ROM combinations. If you experience issues, let the ROM boot once before setting everything up.


## Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues
If you're having issues passing SafetyNet, getting your device certified, or otherwise getting MagiskHide to work, take a look in the [Magisk and MagiskHide Installation and Troubleshooting Guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk). Lots of good info there (if I may say so myself)...

But first: have you tried turning it off and on again? Toggling MagiskHide off and on usually works if MagiskHide has stopped working after an update of Magisk or your ROM.


## Issues, support, etc
If you have questions, suggestions or are experiencing some kind of issue, visit the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228) @ XDA.

### Known issues
- Xiaomi devices (MIUI) often have issues passing the ctsProfile check, particularly China releases. Try using [ShellHide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/magisk-shellhide-t3855616) by @JayminSuthar together with this module. They might work in conjunction to get the device to pass SafetyNet.
- If you're on Android Pie you will have to use Magisk v17.2+. Any version prior to that will not be able to change the required prop values. This is because of a change in Android Pie, and in Magisk v17.2 the resetprop tool has been updated for this change.

### An option is marked as "disabled"
A couple of the options in the `props` script will be automatically disabled in some circumstances. These are:  
- _"Edit device fingerprint"_ will be disabled if another Magisk module that is known to also edit the device fingerprint is installed. Check the logs to get information about which module this is.
- _"Improved hiding"_ will be disable if all relevant prop values already are "safe".

### I can't pass the ctsProfile check
See ["I still can't pass the ctsProfile check"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#i-still-cant-pass-the-ctsprofile-check) above.

Also see ["Props don't seem to set properly"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#props-dont-seem-to-set-properly) below.

### I can't pass the basicIntegrity check
This module can only really help with the ctsProfile check, by spoofing the device fingerprint. If you can't pass basicIntegrity, there's probably something else going on with your device. See ["Miscellaneous MagiskHide issues"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config/blob/master/README.md#miscellaneous-magiskhide-issues) above.

### Props don't seem to set properly
If it seems like props you're trying to set with the module don't get set properly (ctsProfile still doesn't pass, custom props don't work, etc), go into the script options and change the execution of the boot script to post-fs-data. See ["Boot stage"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/MagiskHide-Props-Config#boot-stage) above.

### My device's Android security patch date changed
For some devices, when using an Android Pie fingerprint, it is necessary to also change the security patch date to match the fingerprint. This is automatically done by the module when using a Pie fingerprint. If you do not want this to happen you can manually add `ro.build.version.security_patch` to the custom props and add back the original date.

### Device issues because of the module
In case of issues, if you've set a prop value that doesn't work on your device causing it not to boot, etc, don't worry. There are options. You can follow the advice in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/Magisk#hn_Module_causing_issues_Magisk_functionality_bootloop_loss_of_root_etc) to remove or disable the module, or you can use the module's built-in options to reset all module settings to the defaults.

Place a file named `reset_mhpc` in /cache (or /data/cache on A/B devices) and reboot.

It is possible to use this in combination with the configuration file described above to keep device fingerprint or any other settings intact past the reset. Just make sure to remove any custom props that might have been causing issues from the configuration file.

### The Play Store is "uncertified"
If your device's Play Store reports that the device is "uncertified", this is usually fixed by making sure that you pass SafetyNet and then clearing data for the Play Store (and possibly rebooting). More details in the [Magisk troubleshooting guide](https://www.didgeridoohan.com/magisk/MagiskHide#hn_Device_uncertified_in_Play_storeNetflix_and_other_apps_wont_install_or_doesnt_show_up).

## Logs
In case of issues, please provide the logs by running the `props` script and selecting the "Collect logs" option (or running the `props` script with the -l option, use -h for details). All the relevant logs and module files, together with the Magisk log, the stock build.prop file and current prop values will be packaged into a file that'll be stored in the root of the device's internal storage, ready for attaching to a post in the [module support thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/module-magiskhide-props-config-t3789228), together with a detailed description of your problem.

The logs will also automatically be saved to the root of the device's internal storage if there's an issue with the module scripts.

### Collecting logs manually
If you can't run the `props` script for some reason, the logs are also stored in /cache (or /data/cache for A/B devices). The Magisk log and any files starting with "propsconf" would be useful for troubleshooting (if you don't, or can't, use the "Collect logs" option mentioned above). Providing the output from terminal might also be useful.
